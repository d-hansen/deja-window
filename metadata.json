  "description": "Deja Window is a GNOME Shell extension that gives you full control over your window geometry. It automatically restores the size, position, and maximized state of specific applications when they open.\n\n🤔 Why Deja Window?\n\nIn \"vanilla\" GNOME, windows typically open either centered or in a upper-left layout. This behavior stems from two main factors:\nDeja Window bridges this gap by acting as an external memory for your window layout, forcing the desired position and size that the OS or the apps themselves cannot natively restore. Deja Window is also very useful for all those applications (such as Ghostty) that do not adequately manage the layout of their windows in Gnome.\n\n🚀 Features\n\n- Remembers the last known position and dimensions of your windows. \n- Configure specific rules per application (via WM_CLASS). \n- Supports standard string matching and regular expressions (Regex) for advanced targeting. \n- Choose to restore size, position, and maximized state independently for each app.\n- Automatically centers windows that are configured but haven't been saved yet.\n- Handles the specific timing constraints of window management on Wayland.\n\nCompatibility Note: While this extension works with the majority of standard applications, some apps utilize custom layout mechanisms or non-standard toolkits that may override or ignore the extension's positioning attempts.\n",
